---

## Prerequisites

- No build tools required.
- A browser wallet like **MetaMask** or **Rabby** (optional, but needed to play).
- Run through a **static server** (opening `index.html` via `file://` may cause ES Modules/Clipboard errors).

---

## Run Locally

### Option 1) Python (simple, no extra install)
```bash
# From the project root
python -m http.server 8000
# Open in your browser:
# http://localhost:8000
